Hi, I’m Rishav and I empower teams by fostering **scalable growth** with a tight feedback loop – backed by automation from code to clients. I can best express this with DevOps processes: bridging the gap between cloud-based solutions and grounded perception from 5+ years of experience.

I’m based in Edinburgh, UK (UTC +01:00) where I’m engaged in a **remote, permanent role** as a Senior DevOps Engineer of AWS Cloud Platforms at @tucows: a publicly traded internet services and telecommunications business.

When I’m not in front of a laptop, you can find me tramping o’er the wee crags of Scotland, in search of the elusive sunshine. Happy to chat all things **cloud engineering**, so feel free to connect: www.linkedin.com/in/rishavdhar 🖇️

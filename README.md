Hi, I‚Äôm Rishav and I empower teams by fostering **scalable growth** with a close feedback loop ‚Äì backed by automation from code to clients. I can best express this with DevOps processes: bridging the gap between cloud-based solutions and grounded perception from 5+ years of experience.

I‚Äôm based in Edinburgh, UK (GMT) where I‚Äôm engaged in a **remote, permanent role** as a Senior DevOps Engineer of AWS Cloud Platforms at @tucows: a publicly traded internet services and telecommunications business.

When I‚Äôm not in front of a laptop, you can find me tramping o‚Äôer the wee crags of Scotland, in search of the elusive sunshine. Happy to chat all things **cloud engineering**, so feel free to connect: <www.linkedin.com/in/rishavdhar> üñáÔ∏è
